		<h3>Harrison Berger is the co-founder and creative director of Longest Title Productions.</h3>
		<p>Harrison is an artist, writer, director and producer from Scottsdale, Arizona. Did someone say triple threat?</p>
		<p>Harrison has an undying passion for storytelling. He originally poured his entire creative being into illustration and fine art for years to eventually become a comic book artist, but 7 years ago he came to the realization that his passion is filmmaking. Harrison knew that filmmaking was the only way to advance his storytelling abilities. On top of being highly creative, Harrison has experience planning fundraisers, campaigns, and raising funds and resources.</p>
		<p>Harrison is constantly surrounded by something that inspires him. He tries to find a story in everything because he believes everything and everyone has a story to be told. And if possible, every story should be heard.</p>
